Using provided script run_analysis.R you could get the data set that contains average meanings 
for different observations (linear acceleration, angular velocity in 3 dimensions) that were done
during experiments with 30 participants wearing a smartphone during 6 different kinds of activities:
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 

Data contains 4 columns

Subject:
   Point to the number of participant of experiments from 1 to 30
   
Activity:
  Point to the performed activity, one of six following:
  WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
  
variable:
  Contains for every activity of every participant the list of measurement types.
  Variables are in the format "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", where 1st part ("tBodyAcc") is
  a measured parameter, 2nd part ("mean()") is used method (mean() - for means, 
  std() for standard deviations, meanFreq() - for weighted average of the frequency 
  components), 3rd part is a dimension (X, Y or Z)
